## üîê API Configuration

This program uses a `.env` file to securely load your Infura WebSocket Project ID.

Create a `.env` file with the following content:

```env
INFURA_PROJECT_ID=your_infura_project_id_here
```

The application automatically loads this variable using the `python-dotenv` library.
